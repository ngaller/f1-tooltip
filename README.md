# f1-tooltip

Simple tooltip component.

 * It's very specific to my needs on a particular project.
 * Will only display on top / bottom
 * There is no automatic activation.  Include the tooltip when you want it displayed.
 * You have to pass the X and Y where you want it to appear.  In my use case, that is maintained
 by a Redux store.  The X and Y are relative to the viewport, not the container.
